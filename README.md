This time we will be writing a responsive website and also adding some animation there. All files are taken from YouTube tutorials. All code will be HTML and CSS only.

The entire repository will be public, and if someone wants to upload or download all the files, then nothing bad will happen. Note that there are almost no comments in the code as this is a very lightweight page.

If you find any bugs, please contact the social network, sincerely, Adams Midov!


P.S.
By the way, to try everything, you need to change the jQuery file. Or the page will just load!
